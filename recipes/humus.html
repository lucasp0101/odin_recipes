        <p>
            Hummus is a dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas <br>
            blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. It is popular in the Middle <br>
            East and Mediterranean, as well as in Middle Eastern cuisine around the globe. <br> 
            It can also be found in most grocery stores in North America and Europe. <br>
        </p>

        <p>    
            Hummus is high in iron and vitamin C, and also has significant amounts of <br>
            folate and vitamin B6. The chickpeas make it a good source of protein and <br>
            dietary fiber; the tahini consists mostly of sesame seeds, which are an <br>
            excellent source of the amino acid methionine, complementing the proteins <br>
            in the chickpeas. Depending on the recipe, hummus carries varying amounts <br>
            of monounsaturated fat. Hummus is useful in vegetarian and vegan diets and <br>
            like other combinations of grains and pulses, when eaten with bread it <br>
            serves as a complete protein.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            It can be served with pita bread, crackers, tortilla chips, or raw vegetables<br> 
            such as carrots and celery. It is usually eaten as a snack or appetizer, but <br>
            may also be eaten as a meal.
